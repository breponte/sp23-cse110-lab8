# Lab 8

1. **Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?** In my Recipe project development pipeline, I would fit my automated tests in my project by manually running them locally before pushing code. Although implementing them within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed allows for incremental testing and functionality which is valuable in Software Engineering, the scale of the Recipe project so far is small as well as an individual project. Creating an entire CI/CD pipeline for a small project seems overkill since you are the only one pushing and testing the code. If the project were to scale then GitHub Actions would be more necessary. However, since the scale is small, running the tests locally before pushing the code is enough, especially since repeated committing and pushing just to test code seems very unprofessional. Another alternative not stated in the options is to create a GitHooks like my team did in order to have redundancy for security. There would be GitHub Actions tests, but a GitHook would allow for local testing from the GitHub Actions in order to prevent committing and pushing broken code.
2. **Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?** No, because end to end tests are more for testing user experience. Unit testing is more suited for testing correctness.
